About VCPkg
===========

This is a public vcpkg package registry for my packages. Maybe someone may
want to mainline it into the regular vcpkg registry.

The update.cmd is used to update the versions database after any ports have
been updated and commited. This feels broken as it makes all updating a two
commit process, but indeed seems to be what a registry requires.
